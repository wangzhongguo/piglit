/**
 * \file glsl-link-initializer-03.c
 * Test linking a single shader into two programs.
 *
 * Each of the 3 shaders involved in this test have a global variable called
 * \c global_variable.  Two of the shaders have (differing) initializers for
 * this variable, and the other lacks an initializer.  The test verifies that
 * the shader lacking an initializer can successfully be linked with each of
 * the shaders that have initalizers.
