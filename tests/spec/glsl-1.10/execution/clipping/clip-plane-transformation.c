/**
 * \file clipping-transforms.c
 *
 * This test verifies that clip planes are transformed using the
 * correct matrices, at the correct times.
 *
 * The transformations affecting clipping in fixed functionality mode
 * (with no vertex shader) are described in the OpenGL 2.1 spec,
 * section 2.12 ("Clipping"):
 *
 *     "A client-defined clip plane is specified with
 *
 *         void ClipPlane( enum p, double eqn[4] );
 *
 *     ... eqn is an array of four double-precision floating-point
 *     values. These are the coefficients of a plane equation in
 *     object coordinates: p1 , p2 , p3 , and p4 (in that order). The
 *     inverse of the current model-view matrix is applied to these
 *     coefficients, at the time they are specified, yielding
 *
 *         (p1' p2' p3' p4') = (p1 p2 p3 p4) M^-1
 *
 *     (where M is the current model-view matrix; the resulting plane
 *     equation is undefined if M is singular and may be inaccurate if
 *     M is poorly-conditioned) to obtain the plane equation
 *     coefficients in eye coordinates.  All points with eye
 *     coordinates (xe ye ze we)^T that satisfy
 *
 *         (p1' p2' p3' p4') (xe ye ze we)^T >= 0
 *
 *     lie in the half-space defined by the plane; points that do not
 *     satisfy this condition do not lie in the half-space."
 *
 * Thus, the clip planes should be modified by the value of the
 * model-view matrix at the time clip planes are specified; the value
 * of the model-view transformation at drawing time should have no
 * effect on which part of the scene is clipped.
 *
 * The projection matrix, on the other hand, should be the opposite:
 * its value at the time clip planes are specified should have no
 * effect, but its value at drawing time should determine where on the
 * screen clipping takes place (since clipping is performed on eye
 * coordinates, before the perspective matrix is applied).
 *
 * The transformations affecting clipping when a vertex shader is
 * present can be inferred from the text that follows:
 *
 *     "When a vertex shader is active, the vector (xe ye ze we)^T is
 *     no longer computed. Instead, the value of the gl_ClipVertex
 *     built-in variable is used in its place."
 *
 * So, as before, the model-view matrix affects clip planes at the
 * time they are specified, but not at draw time.  However, the
 * projection matrix no longer necessarily has an effect; instead, the
 * place on the screen where clipping takes place is determined by the
 * relationship between the values of gl_Position and gl_ClipVertex
 * that are output by the vertex shader.
 *
 * It's also possible that the vertex shader might not store a value
 * in gl_ClipVertex at all; what happens in this case is less clear.
 * According to the GL 2.1 spec (from the same section):
 *
 *     "If gl ClipVertex is not written by the vertex shader, its
 *     value is undefined, which implies that the results of clipping
 *     to any client-defined clip planes are also undefined."
 *
 * The GL 3.0 spec says the same thing, and the GLSL 1.10 and 1.20
 * specs have compatible language (from section 7.1: Vertex Shader
 * Special Variables):
 *
 *     "If gl_PointSize or gl_ClipVertex are not written to, their
 *     values are undefined."
 *
 * However, the GLSL 1.30 spec says:
 *
 *     "If a linked set of shaders forming the vertex stage contains
 *     no static write to gl_ClipVertex or gl_ClipDistance, but the
 *     application has requested clipping against user clip planes
 *     through the API, then the coordinate written to gl_Position is
 *     used for comparison against the user clip planes."
 *
 * So, if GLSL 1.30 is to be believed, if the vertex shader does not
 * write to gl_Position, then the place on the screen where clipping
 * takes place is determined exclusively by the plane equation (p1'
 * p2' p3' p4').  No further transformation is applied.
 *
 * Note that strictly speaking, this doesn't contradict any of the
 * other specs, since a conformant implementation may do anything it
 * desires when behavior is "undefined", including clipping based on
 * gl_Position.  Since this behavior is only specified in GLSL 1.30,
 * we include a "#version 130" directive in the shader when testing
 * it.
 *
 *
 * The test operates by constructing four clip plane equations which
 * are only satisfied by points within a small square region near (1,
 * 0).  Setting all matrices to the identity matrix, and setting
 * gl_Position == gl_ClipVertex == gl_Vertex, it draws a large square,
 * large enough to cover the entire window, and then probes the
 * resulting image to determine where pixels were actually drawn; due
 * to clipping, they should be drawn only near (1, 0).
 *
 * Then it performs a 20 degree rotation in each of the following ways
 * in turn, leaving all other transformations as the identity
 * transformation:
 * - Using the model-view matrix at the time clip planes are specified
 * - Using the projection matrix at the time clip planes are specified
 * - Using the model-view matrix at the time of drawing
 * - Using the projection matrix at the time of drawing
 * - Using the vertex shader to rotate gl_Position with respect to gl_Vertex
 * - Using the vertex shader to rotate gl_ClipVertex with respect to gl_Vertex
 *
 * In each case it probes the resulting image to determine where
 * pixels were actually drawn, and compares the result to the expected
 * behavior from the spec.
 *
 *
 * The test may be run in one of four modes, chosen with a single
 * command line argument:
 * - "fixed": test using fixed functionality (no vertex shader)
 * - "arb": test using GL_ARB_vertex_program extension (see below)
 * - "pos": test using a vertex shader that sets gl_Position only
 * - "pos_clipvert": test using a vertex shader that sets gl_Position first,
 *                   then gl_ClipVertex
 * - "clipvert_pos": test using a vertex shader that sets gl_ClipVertex first,
 *                   then gl_Position
 *
 * The reason for distinguishing between "pos_clipvert" and
 * "clipvert_pos" is that in the present Mesa implementation, the
 * variables gl_Position and gl_ClipVertex are aliases of each other,
 * so the order in which values are stored into these two variables
 * may affect shader behavior.
 *
 * Note: "arb" mode tests using an ARB vertex program, as defined in
 * the GL_ARB_vertex_program extension.  From the extension spec:
 *
 *     "User-defined clipping is not supported in standard vertex
 *     program mode.  User-defined clipping support will be provided
 *     for programs that use the "position invariant" option, where
 *     all vertex transformation operations are performed by the
 *     fixed-function pipeline."
 *
 * The strong implication seems to be that for ARB vertex programs
 * that use the "position invariant" option, clipping should behave as
 * it does in fixed function mode.
