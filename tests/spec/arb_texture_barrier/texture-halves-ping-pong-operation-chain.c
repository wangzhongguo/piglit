/** @file texture-halves-ping-pong-operation-chain.c
 *
 * From the GL_ARB_texture_barrier spec:
 *
 *  "Specifically, the values of rendered fragments are undefined if any
 *  shader stage fetches texels and the same texels are written via fragment
 *  shader outputs, even if the reads and writes are not in the same Draw
 *  call, unless any of the following exceptions apply:
 *
 *  - The reads and writes are from/to disjoint sets of texels (after
 *    accounting for texture filtering rules).
 *
 *  - There is only a single read and write of each texel, and the read is in
 *    the fragment shader invocation that writes the same texel (e.g. using
 *    "texelFetch2D(sampler, ivec2(gl_FragCoord.xy), 0);").
 *
 *  - If a texel has been written, then in order to safely read the result
 *    a texel fetch must be in a subsequent Draw separated by the command
 *
 *      void TextureBarrier(void);
 *
 *    TextureBarrier() will guarantee that writes have completed and caches
 *    have been invalidated before subsequent Draws are executed."
 *
 * This test aims to test points 1 and 3 of that statement.
 *
 * It uses an uint texture bound as the colorbuffer and texture sampler
 * source. It renders 6 passes.
 * Every pass one half of the texture is sampled from while the other is
 * written to. Which is which is swapped every pass.
 * The operations in the passes are chosen so that the end result will differ
 * if any pass is missing or the passes aren't executed in the correct order.
