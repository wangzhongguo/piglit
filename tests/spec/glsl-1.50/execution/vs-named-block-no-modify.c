/**

 * Test that uniform variables contained within a named uniform block cannot be
 * accessed by the glUniform* commands.
 *
 * Section 2.11.4 (Uniform Variables) of the GL 3.2 spec says:
 *  "Uniforms in a named uniform block are not assigned a location and may
 *   not be modified using the Uniform* commands."
 *
 * Test relies on the behavior of glGetUniform returning -1 for uniforms
 * that have not been assigned a location, such as those in a named uniform
 * block.
