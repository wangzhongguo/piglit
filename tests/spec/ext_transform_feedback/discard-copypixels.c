/**
 * @file discard-copypixels.c
 *
 * Tests that GL_RASTERIZER_DISCARD appropriately affects glCopyPixels().
 *
 * From the EXT_transform_feedback spec:
 *
 *     "Primitives can be optionally discarded before rasterization by
 *      calling Enable and Disable with RASTERIZER_DISCARD_EXT. When
 *      enabled, primitives are discarded right before the
 *      rasterization stage, but after the optional transform feedback
 *      stage. When disabled, primitives are passed through to the
 *      rasterization stage to be processed
 *      normally. RASTERIZER_DISCARD_EXT applies to the DrawPixels,
 *      CopyPixels, Bitmap, Clear and Accum commands as well."
