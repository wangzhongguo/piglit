 * From the GLSL 1.30 spec, section 7.1 (Vertex Shader Special
 * Variables):
 *
 *   It is an error for a shader to statically write both
 *   gl_ClipVertex and gl_ClipDistance.
 *
 * This test verifies that an error is generated if the shader
 * contains writes to both variables, even if those writes would never
 * both occur in the same render.
