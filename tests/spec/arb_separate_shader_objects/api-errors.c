	/* Issue #7 of the GL_ARB_separate_shader_objects spec says:
	 *
	 *     "7.  What happens if you have a program object current for a
	 *          shader stage, but the program object doesn't contain an
	 *          executable for that stage?
	 *
	 *          RESOLVED: This is not an error; instead it is as though
	 *          there were no program bound to that stage.  We have two
	 *          different notions for programs bound to shader stages.  A
	 *          program is "current" for a stage if it bound to that stage
	 *          in the active program pipeline object.  A program is
	 *          "active" for a stage if it is current and it has an
	 *          executable for this stage.  In this case, the program
	 *          would be current but not active.
	 *
	 *          When no program is active for a stage, the stage will be
	 *          replaced with fixed functionality logic (compatibility
	 *          profile vertex and fragment), disabled (tessellation
	 *          control and evaluation, geometry), or have undefined
	 *          results (core profile vertex and fragment).
	 *
	 *          Support for programs that are current but not active is
	 *          intentional behavior.  Consider an example where an
	 *          application wants to use two different types of separate
	 *          program object -- one for all types of vertex processing
	 *          and a second for fragment processing.  Some of the vertex
	 *          pipe programs might include tessellation or geometry
	 *          shaders; others might only include a vertex shader.  With
	 *          this configuration, the application can use code like the
	 *          following:
	 *
	 *            #define GL_ALL_VERTEX_PIPE_SHADER_BITS	\
	 *                (GL_VERTEX_SHADER_BIT             |	\
	 *                 GL_TESS_CONTROL_SHADER_BIT       |	\
	 *                 GL_TESS_EVALUATION_SHADER_BIT    |	\
	 *                 GL_GEOMETRY_SHADER_BIT)
	 *
	 *            glUseProgramStages(pipeline,
	 *                               GL_ALL_VERTEX_PIPE_SHADER_BITS,
	 *                               vertex_pipe_program);
	 *            glUseProgramStages(pipeline, GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER_BIT,
	 *                               fragment_pipe_program);
	 *
	 *        Such code wouldn't have to determine if
	 *        <vertex_pipe_program> has tessellation or geometry shaders.
	 *        Instead, it simply sets all possible bits, which removes the
	 *        old program from all non-fragment stages.  For stages not
	 *        present in the new program, the program will be current but
	 *        not active, and it will be as though no program were bound
	 *        to such stages."
	 *
	 * Further, the body of the spec says:
	 *
	 *     "If UseProgramStages is called with <program> set to zero or
	 *     with a program object that contains no executable code for a
	 *     given stages, it is as if the pipeline object has no
	 *     programmable stage configured for the indicated shader stages."
	 *
	 * This indicated to me that the "program == 0" and "program doesn't
	 * have the specified stage" cases should both cause
	 * glGetProgramPipelineiv to return zero for the GL_*_SHADER query.
