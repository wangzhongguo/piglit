/** \file pipeline_stats_geom.c
 *
 *  This test verifies that the vertex shader related tokens of
 *  ARB_pipeline_statistics_query() work as expected. OpenGL 4.4 Specification,
 *  Core Profile.
 *
 *  When BeginQuery is called with a target of GEOMETRY_SHADER_INVOCATIONS,
 *  the geometry shader invocations count maintained by the GL is set to zero.
 *  When a geometry shader invocations query is active, the counter is
 *  incremented every time the geometry shader is invoked (see section 11.3).
 *  In case of instanced geometry shaders (see section 11.3.4.2) the geometry
 *  shader invocations count is incremented for each separate instanced
 *  invocation.
 *
 *  When BeginQuery is called with a target of GEOMETRY_SHADER_PRIMITIVES_-
 *  EMITTED_ARB, the geometry shader output primitives count maintained by the
 *  GL is set to zero. When a geometry shader primitives emitted query is
 *  active, the counter is incremented every time the geometry shader emits
 *  a primitive to a vertex stream that is further processed by the GL (see
 *  section 11.3.2). Restarting primitive topology using the shading language
 *  built-in functions EndPrimitive or EndStreamPrimitive does not increment
 *  the geometry shader output primitives count.
 *
 *  (The chicken clause)
 *  The result of geometry shader queries may be implementation dependent due
 *  to reasons described in section 11.1.3.
