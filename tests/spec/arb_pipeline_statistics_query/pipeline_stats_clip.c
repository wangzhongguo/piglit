/** \file pipeline_stats_clip.c
 *
 * This test verifies that the clipper related tokens of
 * ARB_pipeline_statistics_query() work as expected. I believe these values
 * are safe to use on all hardware but I am not certain.
 *
 * As with the vertex information, there seems to be a clause which allows
 * implementations to make non-deterministic values (13.5 quoted below).
 *
 * 13.5 (the chicken clause)
 *
 *  Implementations are allowed to pass incoming primitives unchanged and to
 *  output multiple primitives for an incoming primitive due to implementation
 *  dependent reasons as long as the results of rendering otherwise remain
 *  unchanged.
 *
 * 13.5.2
 *  When BeginQuery is called with a target of CLIPPING_INPUT_PRIMITIVES_ARB,
 *  the clipping input primitives count maintained by the GL is set to zero.
 *  When a clipping input primitives query is active, the counter is
 *  incremented every time a primitive reaches the primitive clipping stage
 *  (see section 13.5).
 *
 *  When BeginQuery is called with a target of CLIPPING_OUTPUT_PRIMITIVES_ARB,
 *  the clipping output primitives count maintained by the GL is set to zero.
 *  When a clipping output primitives query is active, the counter is
 *  incremented every time a primitive passes the primitive clipping stage.
 *  The actual number of primitives output by the primitive clipping stage for
 *  a particular input primitive is implementation dependent (see section 13.5)
 *  but must satisfy the following conditions.
 *
 * (Chicken clause 2)
 *  If RASTERIZER_DISCARD is enabled, implementations are allowed to
 *  discard primitives right after the optional transform feedback state
 *  (see Section 14.1). As a result, if RASTERIZER_DISCARD is enabled,
 *  the clipping input and output primitives count may not be
 *  incremented.
 *
 * To me, this makes it sound like this is impossible to test RASTERIZER_DISCARD
 * reliably, so I won't bother.
