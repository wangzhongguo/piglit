/** \file pipeline_stats_frag.c
 *
 * This test verifies that the fragment shader related tokens of
 * ARB_pipeline_statistics_query() work as expected. I believe these values
 * are safe to use on all hardware but I am not certain. One again we get the
 * beloved, "can't rely on values clause." For the most part this makes senes
 * since implementations can very well process too many vertices - but the
 * clause also allows too few. The former case is accounted for within this code.
 *
 * 15.2 (Another chicken clause)
 *  Implementations are allowed to skip the execution of certain fragment
 *  shader invocations, and to execute additional fragment shader invocations
 *  during programmable fragment processing due to implementation dependent
 *  reasons, including the execution of fragment shader invocations when there
 *  isn't an active program object present for the fragment shader stage, as
 *  long as the results of rendering otherwise remain unchanged.
 *
 * 15.3
 *  When BeginQuery is called with a target of FRAGMENT_SHADER_INVOCATIONS_ARB,
 *  the fragment shader invocations count maintained by the GL is set to zero.
 *  When a fragment shader invocations query is active, the counter is
 *  incremented every time the fragment shader is invoked (see section 15.2).
 *  The result of fragment shader queries may be implementation dependent due
 *  to reasons described in section 15.2.
