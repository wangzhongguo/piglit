/** \file pipeline_stats_vert.c
 *
 *  This test verifies that the vertex shader related tokens of
 *  ARB_pipeline_statistics_query() work as expected. OpenGL 4.4 Specification,
 *  Core Profile.
 *
 *  Section 11.1.3 as quoted below makes it sound like we can't actually
 *  reliably count on any of these values. Consider that information when
 *  investigating failures.
 *
 * 10.1
 *  When BeginQuery is called with a target of VERTICES_SUBMITTED_ARB, the
 *  submitted vertices count maintained by the GL is set to zero. When a
 *  vertices submitted query is active, the submitted vertices count is
 *  incremented every time a vertex is transferred to the GL (see sections
 *  10.3.4, and 10.5). In case of primitive types with adjacency information
 *  (see sections 10.1.11 through 10.1.14) only the vertices belonging to the
 *  main primitive are counted but not the adjacent vertices. In case of line
 *  loop primitives implementations are allowed to count the first vertex
 *  twice for the purposes of VERTICES_SUBMITTED_ARB queries.  Additionally,
 *  vertices corresponding to incomplete primitives may or may not be
 *  counted.
 *
 *  When BeginQuery is called with a target of PRIMITIVES_SUBMITTED_ARB, the
 *  submitted primitives count maintained by the GL is set to zero. When a
 *  primitives submitted query is active, the submitted primitives count is
 *  incremented every time a point, line, triangle, or patch primitive is
 *  transferred to the GL (see sections 10.1, 10.3.5, and 10.5). Restarting a
 *  primitive topology using the primitive restart index has no effect on the
 *  issued primitives count. Incomplete primitives may or may not be counted.
 *
 * 11.1.3 (the chicken clause)
 *  Implementations are allowed to skip the execution of certain shader
 *  invocations, and to execute additional shader invocations for any shader
 *  type during programmable vertex processing due to implementation dependent
 *  reasons, including the execution of shader invocations that don't have an
 *  active program object present for the particular shader stage, as long as
 *  the results of rendering otherwise remain unchanged.
