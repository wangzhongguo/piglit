# Test the "fast clear" functionality of i965/gen7+ when two clears
# are done to the same buffer, but with drawing in between (so the
# second clear is not redundant).
#
# Fast clear functionality on i965/gen7+ operates by deferring the
# memory writes that would normally be done during a buffer clear so
# that they happen either during rendering or at the time buffer data
# is read (e.g. by glReadPixels).  If two fast clears appear in a row,
# the second clear can be elided.  But if rendering occurs between
# the two fast clears, the second clear is necessary, since some of
# the first clear's writes may already have been performed.
#
# This test verifies that in the case where two fast clears are
# separated by rendering, the second clear is actually performed.
