/**
 * \file idtech-extension-strings.c
 * Verify extensions used by idTech2 and idTech3 games occur in the first 2k
 *
 * For a long time idTech2- and idTech3-based games contained a bug in
 * extension string handling.  The engine would copy the extension string
 * returned by the driver into a buffer on the stack.  The engine would not be
 * able to detect the existence of any extensions that occurred after the size
 * of the buffer.
 *
 * A 2011 Wine bug
 * (https://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-bugs/2011-June/280463.html) suggests
 * that the limit for at least Return to Castle Wofenstein is 4k.  Some other
 * evidence suggests that other games may have limits as low as 2k.
 *
 * Based on this evidence, my guess is that the buffer is 2k, but extension
 * strings longer than 4k caused enough of a stack over run to lead to a
 * crash.
 *
 * There are separate subtests for each game that has a different set of
 * extension strings.  This acts as a catalog of sorts for which games use
 * which extensions.  It also makes it clear which games have been tested.
