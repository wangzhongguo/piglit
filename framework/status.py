""" Provides classes that represent test statuses

These classes work similar to enums in other languages. They provide a limited
set of attributes that are defined per status:

A name -- a string representation of the values
An integer -- a value that allows classes to be compared using python's rich
comparisons
A tuple representing :
  [0] -- whether the test is considered a passing status
  [1] -- whether the test should be added to the total number of tests. This
         allows statuses like 'skip' to not affect the total percentage.


Status ordering from best to worst:

pass
warn
dmesg-warn
fail
dmesg-fail
timeout
crash
incomplete

SKIP and NOTRUN are not factored into regressions and fixes, they are counted
separately. They also derive from a sublcass of Status, which always returns
False

The formula for determining regressions is:
  old_status < new_status

The formula for determining fixes is:
  old_status > new_status
